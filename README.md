# Weather React App
A weather application that allows users to input a city name and view the current weather conditions for that location. Unlike some weather apps that retrieve hourly or daily forecast data from APIs, my app provides only the current weather information. Upon entering a city name, users are presented with details such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions in real-time. The app's interface is designed to be user-friendly, with a simple input field for city names and a clear display area for weather information.
